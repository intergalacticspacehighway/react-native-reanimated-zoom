## Known issues

- https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/issues/1804#issuecomment-1019819191 Currently pan and pinch gesture are not triggering simultaneously in expo managed workflow. I'll look into it when I have some time. This issue doesn't happen on bare react native, release or expo dev client builds.
